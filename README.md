Wine is a beverage made from fermented grape and other fruit juices with lower 
amounts of alcohol content. Quality of wine is graded based on the taste of wine 
and vintage. This process is time taking, costly and not efficient. A wine itself 
includes different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual 
sugar, chlorides, free sulphur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, 
alcohol and quality. 

Objective: 

Our main objective is to predict the wine quality using machine learning.A large 
dataset is considered and wine quality is modelled to analyse the quality of wine 
through different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity etc. All these 
parameters will be analysed through Machine Learning algorithms like random 
forest classifier algorithm which will helps to rate the wine on scale 1 - 10 or bad - 
good or 0-1. 


Data-Description: 

The dataset used is Wine Quality Data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality. 
Input variables are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free 
sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol. 
Output variable is is quality (score between 0 and 10). 

Final results: 

The Model Predicts the quality as 0 or 1. 0 Being bad and 1 Being Good. 
The Model is also exported out as a “joblib” file, so it can be used to predict in 
different systems or servers.
